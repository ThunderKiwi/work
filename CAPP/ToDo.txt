Online Data Collection
	Notes:
	Instruments: Cut "county" and reduce "grantee" to only those who are participating in online data collection. also cut down to top 5 programs for online data collection.
		Is there enough there to properly parse out who's in what class (IP, date & time, program, grantee)?
		Educator form: must have definition, remove extraneous information (as quick and easy as possible), do we need a measure of estimated racial breakdown???
		Forms A, B, C: must match paper documents (i.e. cut definitions, race/ethnicity, add/change questions)
		
	Tasks: 
		Update forms (A, B, C, Educator Form)
		Create cleaning syntax document (procedures and example code)
		Double check LH work
